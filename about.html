  <h2>Jayden Sweet</h2>
  <div class="est-year">est. 2008</div>

  <p>
    I have walked long enough to know that beauty alone is never enough—
    but yours is not just of the face; it lives in the way you speak,
    in the way your presence rearranges the air,
    making the world seem suddenly possible in ways it wasn’t before.
    It’s like the quiet comfort of coffee in the early hours,
    that warmth you hold between your hands before the day truly begins.
    You are not the jolt of caffeine, wild and fleeting—
    you are the slow, rich pour that lingers,
    the kind that turns a cold morning into something worth waking for.
    Even in your silences, there is a hum,
    like coffee brewing just out of sight,
    its scent drifting toward me, reminding me there’s something worth staying for.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so, if you’ll allow it—
    let me be the one who learns you slowly,
    the way a person learns the perfect balance in their coffee,
    patiently finding the measure that makes it just right.
    Let me shape my days to your steps,
    as one shapes the ritual of each morning cup—
    not out of need, but out of devotion to the comfort it brings.
    I carry this unshaken wish like a mug kept warm between both hands:
    that when the hours stretch and the seasons change,
    you will reach for me the way you reach for your coffee—
    without question, without hesitation,
    because you have already decided it’s yours.
  </p>
