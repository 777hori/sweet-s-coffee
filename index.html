    <p>
      I have seen, in our quiet moments, a life where you are there, you are here,
      not as a distant figure passing through my days,
      but as the constant presence beside me when the light first spills across the universe.
      The mornings are soft in that imagined place,
      with coffee cooling between our hands and a kind of peace
      that does not need to announce itself.
      Your laughter hangs in the air like a fragrance,
      and even the way your eyes linger turns the stillness into something lovely.
      I picture you brushing the hair from your face, your eyes catching the slow sunlight,
      and in that small motion, the day already feels worth keeping, living.
      It’s strange how the mind can invent entire worlds from a single smile, your smile, specifically—
      but perhaps it is your eyes, quiet, unguarded—that have been my truest compass,
      for in every version of tomorrow I have imagined,
      your eyes have never once been absent.
